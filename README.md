# Deep-Learning

Here I have included various learning and practice content during my Deep Learning journey.

**Great Learning** folder contains lession I practiced while taking foundational course of deep learning by Great Learning Institute.

**NVIDIA Training** folder was part of my NVIDIA Deep Learning Certification.

**Image Captioning** folder has some implementation I followed to train the model to generate the alt-text of the Images. It uses Keras 1.2.2

I am currently working on **Deep Learning NanoDegree** program by Udacity! Will keep updating!
