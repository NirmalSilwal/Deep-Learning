Books to read

We believe that you learn best when you are exposed to multiple perspectives on the same idea. 
As such, we recommend checking out a few of the books below to get an added perspective on Deep Learning.

Grokking Deep Learning by Andrew Trask.

This provides a very gentle introduction to Deep Learning and covers the intuition more than the theory.

Neural Networks And Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen. 
This book is more rigorous than Grokking Deep Learning and includes a lot of fun, interactive visualizations to play with.

The Deep Learning Textbook from Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.
